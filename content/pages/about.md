I have a degree in Pure Mathematics with a Concentration in Cryptography and enjoy learning all aspects of software development. Currently working as a Software Engineer at a manufacturing company where I primarily use Elixir and Python. I love the outdoors being an avid trail runner and skier as well as cyclist. When at home I enjoy reading mystery and science fiction books as well as playing classical piano.
